# dynamically-updating-menu

This project was made as part of the Udacity [Front-end nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd0011). The main objective was to practice manipulating the DOM, so I build a navbar for a landing page with infinite scrolling using JavaScript, based on the sections on the page.
